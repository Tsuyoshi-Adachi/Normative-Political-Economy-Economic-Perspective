## 1. Second-Best Taxation (Part II): Income Tax

### 1.1 Why Labor Income Is the Most Suitable Target for Redistribution

In many countries, labor income (e.g., wages and business income) serves as the primary tax base, and redistribution policies—such as income taxes or public assistance—are implemented through this channel. The main reasons for this are:

- **Large tax base**: A wide portion of the population earns labor or business income, which makes it easier to collect substantial tax revenue.  
- **Easy linkage to individuals**: Personal income can be tracked accurately through mechanisms like withholding (pay-as-you-earn), enabling precise identification of each taxpayer’s income.  
- **Nonlinear taxation is possible**: Because the total income of individuals is tracked, it becomes feasible to impose progressive (graduated) tax rates, where those who earn more pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes.

By contrast, for everyday consumer purchases, only isolated data from each transaction (e.g., receipts) are typically available, making it difficult to track an individual’s **total consumption**. Without knowing how much someone consumes overall, it is nearly impossible to implement a non-linear (e.g., progressive) consumption tax.

## 2. Supplementary Note: The Equivalence of Income Tax and General Commodity Taxation

A well-known point in public finance is that **levying a uniform tax rate on all commodities** is essentially equivalent to **imposing a proportional (linear) tax on income**. For instance:

- **Proportional income tax**: If you tax income $I$ at a constant rate $t$, the take-home income is $(1 - t)I$.  
- **Uniform commodity tax**: If all goods are taxed at rate $t$, the purchasing power of the consumer’s income is effectively multiplied by $(1 - t)$.

Thus, as long as the tax rate is a constant proportion of income (i.e., a linear tax), there is little difference—at least in theory—between an income tax and a uniform commodity tax in terms of how they impact households. However, **progressive taxation** (where the tax rate increases with income) requires knowing an individual’s total income, which is why income taxes are generally the tool of choice for achieving redistribution.

## 3. Assets and Redistribution

### 3.1 Potential for Asset Taxation

Assets—such as stocks, real estate, and savings—are sometimes viewed as attractive targets for redistribution policy because they directly reflect wealth disparities.

### 3.2 Challenges in Asset Taxation and Capital Flight

Nevertheless, many economists are cautious about heavily taxing assets. One key reason is **the presence of close substitutes**:

- **Wealthy individuals can more easily move their assets abroad**, making overseas assets a substitute for domestic ones.  
- When a country sets a high tax rate on domestic assets, investors may transfer their funds overseas, reducing domestic investment and overall economic activity.

France’s wealth tax (ISF) is often cited as an example where high-net-worth individuals relocated their assets, prompting major revisions to the policy. Excessively high inheritance taxes can similarly encourage wealthy individuals to emigrate before their death.

In sum, labor income is typically seen as the most suitable target for redistribution, with progressive income taxes and public assistance forming a second-best approach in many countries. While assets might seem to offer a more direct way to address wealth disparities, the high substitutability of domestic and foreign assets raises significant concerns about capital flight, prompting caution in designing such policies.
