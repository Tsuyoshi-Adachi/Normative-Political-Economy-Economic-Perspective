# Cautions Concerning the Idea of “Division of Labor”

We have seen that the so-called “social welfare function approach,” or the separation of **normative analysis** (which involves value judgments) from **positive/empirical analysis** (which focuses on factual, testable claims), remains widely accepted among modern economists. However, if we treat this separation merely as a form of “division of labor,” we risk misunderstandings when it comes to actual policy discussions or public debates. In this short topic, we will consider why this deserves our careful attention and how to approach the statements and analyses of economists in the real world.

### 1. Should Economists Remain Completely Neutral?
- Some might argue that economists should limit themselves strictly to empirical analysis and refrain from making any policy recommendations. But this does **not** mean economists must stay silent on all policy matters.
- The key point is for an economist to distinguish between the realm of **logical and factual correctness**—where evidence, theory, and data can confirm or refute claims—and the realm where **value judgments and normative considerations** necessarily come into play.
- Even when an economist does offer a policy recommendation, they should be aware of where the analysis shifts from purely scientific reasoning to a stance involving subjective or social values.

### 2. Economists Discussing Policy
- When economists speak to the general public or in the media, they sometimes appear to say, “This policy is scientifically proven to be desirable.” However, public policy proposals and scientific arguments differ in important ways. 
    - For instance, it may be overly cumbersome for every public statement to include caveats such as “This recommendation hinges upon certain value judgments,” so these points can get omitted in popular discourse.
- As listeners and readers, **we** also have a responsibility: we should discern what part of their claims is grounded in empirical, scientific findings, and what part includes **value-laden** judgments or priorities. 
- Trusting science **does not** mean science alone can decide “what ought to be.” After all, science cannot fully dictate moral or political choices.

### 3. Using Economics as a Science
- Economics, like any science, has two faces: it not only aims to produce socially useful analysis but also pursues knowledge for its own sake. 
    - For example, a particular area of research may be extensively studied because **many** economists agree on its policy implications, **or** simply because a new methodology has made it easier or more interesting to investigate.
- Therefore, the quantity of research supporting a certain outcome does **not** necessarily imply that the policy itself is ethically or normatively superior to all alternatives. Scientific studies often clarify relationships or test new models, without directly asserting absolute normative validity.
- Hence, if you decide to adopt a certain policy based on economic analysis, **you** must ultimately take responsibility for the normative rationale behind that choice. Science can inform you about likely consequences, but it cannot fully justify your values.

### 4. Not a “Division of Labor” but a Difference in Criteria
- The separation between normative and positive analysis is **not** a call for everyone to choose one side—“be either a normative economist or a positive economist.” Rather, the idea is that **even the same person** may need to shift between positive/empirical work and normative reasoning, depending on the context.
- Recognizing that there is a domain which cannot be resolved purely by factual or logical arguments does **not** mean we should abandon discussion in that domain. On the contrary, confusion arises if people assume that economics (or science in general) can decide all policy questions.
- We should ask ourselves: “Where, exactly, does fact-based analysis end and value-based judgment begin?” We also need to remember that:
  1. We should strive for logical, rational discourse.
  2. We should respect open criticism and remain tolerant of opposing views.
  3. We should never ignore objective facts.
- Nevertheless, **there is no guarantee of a single, absolute solution** once value judgments enter the picture. That is precisely why, while we should make full use of the rich insights economics offers, each of us ultimately bears the responsibility of making our own decisions on policy issues—aware that our values inform those choices.

By keeping these points in mind, we can better understand how economists approach policy debates and how to interpret claims about “scientifically proven” policy desirability. Above all, we should recognize the limits of science in settling normative questions and be prepared to provide our own justifications for why a policy is right, beyond what the data or models alone can show.
