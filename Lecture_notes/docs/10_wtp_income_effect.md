# Willingness to Pay and the Income Effect

## Introduction
In welfare economics, surplus analysis (consumer surplus, producer surplus, etc.) often uses *willingness to pay* (WTP) as an indicator of benefit. For example, in evaluating policies for a particular market or industry, one can measure consumers’ willingness to pay and treat the difference between that amount and the actual payment as the policy benefit (consumer surplus).

However, what we call “willingness to pay”—which seems to be a straightforward monetary measure—is actually dependent on a consumer’s overall budget or expenditures on other goods. This dependence is known in economics as the **income effect**. When the scope of a policy or market change is small relative to a household’s overall budget, the income effect is often negligible. But when the change is large enough to affect a significant portion of a household’s budget, ignoring the income effect can lead to problematic conclusions.

The lecture will first provide an intuitive understanding of the income effect, then present an example of a large-scale policy scenario to show why simply using willingness to pay as a welfare measure can be misleading.

## 1. What Is the Income Effect?

### (1) Everyday Example: Allowance
Think back to when you were a child. If you had plenty of allowance, you might buy your favorite snacks even if they were a bit more expensive. But if your allowance was running low, you would become more reluctant to buy the *same* snacks at the *same* price. This occurs because having less money increases the value (or *marginal utility*) of each dollar, so your willingness to pay for snacks changes when your available budget changes.

### (2) Adult Example
For an adult, who generally has a larger budget, the value of one dollar may not swing so drastically with everyday purchases. If someone has steady savings and income, small price fluctuations in typical goods might not noticeably alter how they perceive one dollar’s worth.

However, if a particular good or service takes up a **substantial portion** of the household’s budget, then even an adult’s willingness to pay for that good can shift significantly. A large shock to consumption possibilities changes the effective “value of money,” which is precisely the mechanism behind the income effect.

## 2. Example: Hypothetical Policy for Elderly Facilities
To illustrate how the income effect can pose challenges for policy analysis, consider the following (hypothetical) policy:

- **Policy Overview**  
  Suppose there is a government program that offers discounted housing with daily living services (hereafter “service-attached housing”) to seniors whose savings do not exceed a certain threshold. The government sets the price for this service-attached housing at 5 million yen (¥5,000,000).

- **Household A’s Situation**  
  - Household A’s *willingness to pay* for this housing depends on their savings.  
  - Specifically:  
    - If their savings are ¥15 million, they are willing to pay up to ¥10 million.  
    - If their savings are ¥10 million, they are willing to pay up to ¥7 million.  
  - In other words, **the higher their savings, the lower the marginal utility of money, and thus the higher their willingness to pay.**  
  - Currently, Household A has ¥10 million in savings. Because the government-set price is ¥5 million, which is less than the current willingness to pay of ¥7 million, Household A decides to purchase the service-attached housing and gains a surplus of ¥2 million (7 – 5 = 2).

- **Household B’s Situation**  
  - Now consider another household, Household B, which is wealthy.  
  - Although B is not eligible for the program (because its savings exceed the threshold), its willingness to pay for the service-attached housing is actually ¥20 million.  
  - If Household B could purchase this housing, it would gain a very large surplus, but the program rules exclude them.

### 2.1 The Seemingly Beneficial Transfer Plan
At first glance, an economist might propose the following idea:

1. Offer Household A a lump-sum transfer of ¥8 million to relinquish its right to the service-attached housing.  
2. Since A was initially paying ¥5 million and receiving a surplus of ¥2 million, receiving ¥8 million to give up the housing seems better (8 is greater than 7). So A should, in theory, be happy to accept.  
3. Meanwhile, the government (or a third party) sells the freed-up housing to Household B for ¥8 million. Given B’s willingness to pay of ¥20 million, B is also delighted to acquire the housing at ¥8 million.  
4. By transferring the housing from A to B, the total surplus seemingly increases. The plan suggests that both parties could benefit more after redistribution—A gets ¥8 million, B gets a discounted price relative to their willingness to pay.

### 2.2 Why It Actually Fails (Income Effect)
Household A originally had ¥10 million in savings and paid ¥5 million to buy the service-attached housing, leaving ¥5 million in cash. Having a lower cash balance makes each yen more valuable (higher marginal utility), so “¥5 million + housing” yields utility roughly equivalent to having ¥15 million in cash without the housing.

Under the proposed policy, Household A would receive a transfer of ¥8 million in exchange for giving up the housing. In the end, A’s cash would be
$$
¥10{,}000{,}000 + ¥8{,}000{,}000 - ¥5{,}000{,}000 = ¥13{,}000{,}000,
$$
but because having more cash lowers the marginal utility of money, the situation “¥13 million in cash + no housing” provides about ¥2 million *less* utility than having ¥15 million in cash. Thus, from A’s perspective, it loses enough utility to make the proposed arrangement unattractive. This loss of utility reflects the **income effect**.

## Compensating Variation and the Income Effect (For Intermediate Microeconomics Students)

- **Using Indifference Curves**  
  From an indifference-curve perspective, the monetary value of “consuming one additional unit” of a particular good depends on where you start on the indifference map. If your overall income or consumption bundle changes, the marginal rate of substitution (and thus the willingness to pay) also changes.

- **Indifference Curves and Parallel Shifts**  
  In a two-good diagram, you can visualize the value of one more unit of a certain good as the horizontal distance by which you must *shift* your budget constraint to stay on the same indifference curve. That distance—how much income you need to give up for one extra unit of the good—will differ depending on your current level of income or consumption.

- **The Flexibility of Curve Shapes**  
  Given that indifference curves can take many shapes, it is quite common for the exact monetary measure of one unit of a good to vary with the reference point. In fact, it is exceptional (and usually the result of very special preferences) if willingness to pay does *not* change when income changes.

- **Contrasting With Introductory Consumer Theory**  
  At the introductory level, consumer surplus analysis often assumes that the income effect is negligible when changes are small. By contrast, in intermediate microeconomics, you learn about **compensating variation** and **equivalent variation**, which more explicitly measure how much income you would need to compensate for price or quantity changes under different circumstances. These tools allow for a more rigorous treatment of cases where a policy significantly alters a household’s income and thus its willingness to pay.

## 3. Conclusion
- **Use Surplus Analysis for Small-Scale Changes**  
  Surplus = willingness to pay – payment is a helpful framework for evaluating smaller changes in a single market or when the overall budget impact is modest. However, if a policy significantly affects a household’s total budget, the **income effect** becomes non-negligible and can invalidate the simple surplus-based approach.

- **Willingness to Pay Is Not a Direct Measure of “Total Utility”**  
  Willingness to pay does not capture an individual’s *entire* utility from *all* consumption. Instead, it measures how much utility changes *due to a specific policy*. When the policy’s scope is large enough to alter the household’s overall budget state, the “value of money” itself changes (the income effect), and a simple surplus calculation no longer gives a reliable measure of welfare.

**Key Takeaway**  
- For modest interventions, using willingness to pay and the resulting surplus can be both intuitive and sufficient.  
- However, for interventions that significantly alter a household’s overall consumption possibilities, analyzing the **income effect** is crucial.  
- In more advanced microeconomics, this analysis is formalized through indifference curves, compensating variation, and equivalent variation, giving us a more precise lens to evaluate large-scale policy impacts.
