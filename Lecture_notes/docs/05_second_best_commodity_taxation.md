# Second-Best I: Commodity Taxation

## 1. Commodities Suitable for Redistribution

When we implement redistribution through taxes or subsidies on economic activities (i.e., commodity taxes or subsidies), it may be **more efficient** to concentrate the policy on specific markets that are particularly suitable for achieving redistribution, rather than taxing or subsidizing all commodities uniformly. The main reasons are:

- Imposing taxes or subsidies **equally on every market** often generates significant distortions across the entire economy.
- By **targeting markets** that are especially suitable for redistribution, we can achieve the desired tax revenue and redistribution effects **while minimizing unnecessary distortions**.

In this context, “commodities suitable for redistribution” are those where we can effectively tax or subsidize **specific groups** (often high-income vs. low-income consumers) with minimal loss in total surplus. Two key factors in identifying these commodities are **who consumes them** (related to income elasticity) and **whether there are close substitutes** (related to price elasticity).

## 2. Income Elasticity and Redistribution

### 2.1 Quick Review of Income Elasticity

- **Definition**: For a demand function $Q(I)$ where $I$ is income, the income elasticity of demand is:
  $$
  \text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{\partial Q / \partial I}{Q / I}.
  $$
- **Luxury goods**: Have high income elasticity (often greater than 1). Demand rises significantly when income increases.  
- **Normal or “neutral” goods**: Have moderate income elasticity, typically around 1.  
- **Inferior goods**: Have negative income elasticity (demand decreases as income increases).

### 2.2 Taxing Luxury Goods and Subsidizing Inferior Goods

- Generally, **high-income individuals** consume more luxury goods, while **low-income individuals** consume more inferior goods or basic necessities.
- If we identify “high-income = privileged” and “low-income = underprivileged,” then:
  - **Imposing heavier taxes on luxury goods** effectively taxes high-income individuals.
  - **Subsidizing or reducing taxes on inferior goods** (or basic necessities) helps lower-income individuals.
- This strategy can achieve the same total tax revenue while **better targeting the redistribution** from high-income groups to low-income groups.

#### Real-World Examples

- Many countries have **luxury taxes** on high-end products (e.g., luxury cars, designer goods).
- Some countries apply **reduced tax rates or subsidies** to basic food items or public transportation.

These policies illustrate how different income elasticities can guide us to design effective redistributive taxation or subsidies.

## 3. Existence of Substitute Goods and Redistribution

### 3.1 Substitute Goods and Price Elasticity

If a commodity has a close substitute, a price increase (due to taxation) will cause consumers to shift their consumption to the substitute. Consequently, demand for the taxed commodity will drop sharply—indicating a **high price elasticity** of demand for that commodity.

### 3.2 The Relationship Between Price Elasticity and Deadweight Loss

When a tax or subsidy is introduced:

- **Taxes**: The commodity’s price rises, quantity demanded falls, and both consumer surplus and producer surplus decrease. This creates a **deadweight loss**.
- **Subsidies**: The commodity’s price effectively falls, quantity demanded rises, and the government must spend revenue to support the subsidy. This also leads to a **deadweight loss** via overconsumption or overproduction.

The higher the price elasticity (the more sensitive consumers are to price changes), the **larger** the deadweight loss from taxes or subsidies. This is why commodities with close substitutes tend to generate more significant inefficiencies when taxed or subsidized.

### 3.3 Taxing (or Subsidizing) Commodities Without Substitutes

If a commodity has **no close substitutes** (or only very few), then even if its price changes due to taxation, consumers cannot easily switch to another product. The result is:

- **Lower price elasticity**, so **demand will not drop drastically**.  
- **Smaller deadweight loss** (since the quantity distortion is less severe).

The same logic applies to subsidies. Hence, **if the goal is redistribution**, taxing or subsidizing commodities **with no close substitutes** can be more efficient. If close substitutes do exist, all those substitutes would ideally be taxed or subsidized **in tandem** to avoid distortionary substitution effects.

## 4. The “Squared” Inefficiency Rule

### 4.1 How Tax Rates Affect Deadweight Loss

When we increase the tax rate on a commodity:

- **Tax revenue** might initially rise, but it will eventually plateau or even decrease as consumers alter their behavior.
- **Deadweight loss**, however, increases roughly with the **square** of the tax rate. Doubling the tax rate does **more than double** the associated inefficiency.

This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the “**2-squared rule**” (or simply the idea that deadweight loss grows disproportionately faster than the tax rate). The higher the tax rate on a single commodity, the more severe the distortion becomes.

### 4.2 The Case for Uniform Taxation (When No Special Redistributive Properties Exist)

For commodities without particular redistributive benefits, **concentrating taxes on just one or a few commodities** can produce large distortions in those specific markets. By **spreading the tax burden more evenly**, we reduce the severity of deadweight loss in any single market, resulting in lower overall inefficiency.

## 5. Conclusion

Putting these elements together, we can outline a second-best approach to commodity taxes (and subsidies) for redistribution:

1. **Heavier taxes on commodities with high income elasticity and no close substitutes**  
   - This allows efficient extraction of tax revenue primarily from high-income consumers.
2. **Subsidies (or reduced taxes) on commodities with low or negative income elasticity and no close substitutes**  
   - This effectively supports low-income consumers who disproportionately consume these goods.
3. **For all other goods**, especially those without a strong redistributive role, **uniform taxation** helps minimize the overall deadweight loss by not over-taxing specific markets.

In reality, of course, multiple goods interact in complex ways, and the exact policy design must consider actual **price elasticities, income elasticities, and social/political feasibility**. Nevertheless, the above principles provide a framework for thinking about **which commodities** to tax or subsidize when seeking both efficiency and equity through second-best policies.

That concludes our lecture on **Second-Best I: Commodity Taxation**. In subsequent sessions, we will look into practical applications, historical examples, and more nuanced cases where goods are interrelated or where multiple policy tools are used in combination.
