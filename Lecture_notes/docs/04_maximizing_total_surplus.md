# Maximizing Total Surplus

In standard economic theory, many economists argue that for most markets, increasing the total surplus (the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus) should be a key policy goal. Four main reasons are typically cited:

1. **Utilitarianism of Surplus**  
2. **Compensation Principle**  
3. **Second-Best Theory**  
4. **Hicksian Optimism**

In this lecture note, we will focus on two ideas that are considered somewhat “old-fashioned”: (1) **Utilitarianism of Surplus** and (2) the **Compensation Principle**.

## Utilitarianism of Surplus (An Argument from Around a Century Ago)

### Overview
- **Utilitarianism of Surplus** is the view that if a policy increases the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus (i.e., total surplus), then it necessarily improves overall social welfare.
- Historically, roughly a century ago, economists often treated “surplus” as a monetary measure of utility. Therefore, raising total surplus was equated with raising the overall level of utility in society.

### Why Modern Economists Do Not Hold This View
- Modern economists rarely assume a simple identity between “surplus” and “utility” for the following reasons:
  - **Differences in the Marginal Utility of Money**  
    One unit of money (say, \$1) may have different utility values for different people. For example, an additional \$100 might mean very little to a wealthy individual but could be extremely significant for someone who is poor.
  - **Lack of Distributional Considerations**  
    Focusing only on total surplus often neglects how the benefits of a policy are distributed. In reality, distributional outcomes are a central concern in policy evaluation.

### Why It Is Considered “Strange”
- Assuming that “\$1 = the same utility for everyone” is intuitively problematic.  
  - For instance, \$1 means something entirely different for a wealthy individual than for someone with very limited means.
- For these reasons, modern economics generally does not rely solely on “utilitarianism of surplus” and employs more refined methods to evaluate social welfare.

## The Compensation Principle

### What Is the Compensation Principle?
- The Compensation Principle holds that if a policy increases total surplus, then one could, in theory, implement appropriate transfers (i.e., **lump-sum taxation and transfers**) to achieve a Pareto improvement.
- In other words, if such lump-sum taxes and transfers are freely available, a policy that raises total surplus could be turned into one that benefits everyone or at least does not harm anyone (i.e., a Pareto improvement).

#### Relationship to Pareto Improvement
1. Suppose a certain policy increases total surplus.  
2. Using lump-sum taxation and transfers, the government could redistribute that additional surplus to any parties as needed.  
3. As a result, all relevant stakeholders could end up at least as well off as before, with some strictly better off.  
4. This is essentially the definition of a Pareto improvement.
5. Of course, in reality, governments do not necessarily **implement** ideal lump-sum taxes or transfers as assumed in the theory.
6. Still, if society chooses **not** to adopt a policy that could increase total surplus, one can argue that society must have found an even more preferable option. By transitivity, this implies that society would not end up worse off than the original situation.

This is where the principle is often used to justify focusing on total surplus:  
  > “After all, if we wanted, we could always compensate any losers.”

### Why Lump-Sum Taxes and Transfers Are Necessary
- For the above logic to work, one must be able to redistribute income **without** changing people’s economic behavior (i.e., via **lump-sum taxation and transfers**).
- The critical feature of lump-sum taxes and transfers is not merely that they are “fixed amounts”; rather, **the criteria for who pays or who receives must not depend on economic activity**.  
  - If distribution depends on whether someone is employed or on how much they earn, then people’s incentives are altered, changing total surplus.
  - The theoretical use of lump-sum instruments is meant to **keep behavioral distortions minimal while adjusting only the distribution of surplus**.

#### “Society Chooses a Better Option than the Pareto-Improving One” Also Sounds Odd
- It may seem strange to say that a government would forgo a clear Pareto improvement. However, in the compensation principle framework, one can argue that society has discovered an alternative that it considers superior in some broader sense.
- In practice, **perfect** lump-sum taxation and transfers are impossible, so the “Pareto-improving scenario” is usually only hypothetical.

### Example: “Rich” and “Poor”
- Consider a policy where the government transfers a fixed amount from the rich to the poor.
- If “rich” and “poor” are defined by income levels—i.e., **economic activity**—then both groups have incentives to adjust their behavior:  
  - The rich may work less to avoid losing more income.  
  - The poor may work less since they receive income anyway.
- Thus, this transfer scheme is **not** a lump-sum policy—its criteria depend on actual economic outcomes. As a result, the logic of “any redistribution is possible” breaks down whenever people can alter their behavior in response to the policy.

### Choosing Redistribution Targets and Information
- In reality, identifying criteria for redistribution **independent** of economic activity is extremely difficult:
  - Some exceptions might include certain disabilities present at birth or age-related considerations (which do not reflect actions or choices).
  - But for a wide range of redistribution policies, decisions often rely on information about people’s behavior—how they work, earn income, invest, etc.
- As soon as economic behavior matters for policy eligibility, the compensation principle’s assumption of “no behavioral distortions” no longer holds.

### Choosing a “Mysterious Treasure Box”
- An analogy often used: “**There is one treasure box with a prize inside. If you pick the winning box, you get the prize. Therefore, you are effectively assured of the treasure**.”
  1. If you could identify the correct box, you would win (i.e., you would achieve a Pareto improvement).  
  2. However, you do not actually know which box contains the prize because you cannot see inside it.  
  3. Claiming “we can pick the prize box” essentially assumes perfect knowledge or an ideal mechanism, which can be overly optimistic.
- Likewise, redistributing surplus without observing economic outcomes is akin to “choosing the winning box without looking inside,” which is extremely difficult in the real world.
- Hence, although the compensation principle provides a theoretical link—**“If total surplus goes up, we can achieve a Pareto improvement in theory”**—in practice, it is impossible to implement the necessary lump-sum transfers.

## Supplemental Note: What Is a Pareto Improvement?
- A **Pareto improvement** is a change from one situation (policy or institution) to another that makes at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off.
- For example, if a new policy (Policy A) allows one person to gain while everyone else remains at least as well off as before, that is a Pareto improvement.
- Since no one is harmed while at least one person benefits, the society’s overall welfare is said to have increased.
- **Pareto efficiency (or Pareto optimality)** is the state reached when no further Pareto improvements are possible—meaning that any attempt to make someone better off would necessarily make someone else worse off.

### Conclusion
- **Utilitarianism of Surplus** once equated higher total surplus with higher social welfare, but it disregards the fact that one monetary unit could have vastly different utility for different individuals. Consequently, it is rarely used in its original form today.
- **The Compensation Principle** suggests that if total surplus rises, a theoretical lump-sum redistribution could achieve a Pareto improvement. However, real-world constraints make such perfect redistribution nearly impossible.
- As we move forward, we will explore more realistic frameworks, such as Second-Best Theory and distribution-sensitive welfare economics, to better understand the extent to which maximizing total surplus can serve as a practical policy guideline.
