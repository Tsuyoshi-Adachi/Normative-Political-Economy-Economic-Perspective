# Poverty and Sufficientarianism

### 1. Introduction
The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient are useful tools for visualizing the degree of **unevenness in the distribution** of social welfare. However, our normative concerns about ‚Äúfair distribution‚Äù or ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù cannot be fully captured by unevenness alone. In particular, we care deeply about how many people are in disadvantaged positions and how severe those disadvantages are. This lecture first illustrates that concern with an example, then reviews the conceptual definitions of ‚Äúpoverty,‚Äù and finally examines how the approach called **sufficientarianism** relates to issues of poverty.

### 2. The Limits of the Lorenz Curve and the Gini Coefficient
- **Example A:** 50, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105, 105  
- **Example B:** 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 200  

In these examples, both A and B have the **same average**. If you measure statistical unevenness (e.g., variance, Gini coefficient), B appears more unequal because of one person with 200. However, many people might actually judge Society A to be **less desirable**, due to the presence of someone at 50‚Äîa rather low level‚Äîindicating a situation of severe disadvantage.

This highlights that **‚Äúthe presence of someone at a very low level and the severity of that disadvantage‚Äù** is a concern beyond what a mere measure of inequality can capture. Indeed, under **Rawls‚Äôs criterion** or an **Atkinson social welfare function (SWF) with Œµ > 1**, which strongly prioritizes improving the lowest level, Society A is deemed ‚Äúworse‚Äù than Society B in a normative sense.

### 3. Defining Poverty
In everyday language, ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù refers not just to an uneven distribution of income (or welfare), but to a state in which resources essential for maintaining a basic standard of living fall **below a certain threshold**. The definition of poverty varies depending on how that threshold is set. Here, we can say poverty is a situation in which a person‚Äôs income or welfare is ‚Äúinsufficient for a minimally decent human life.‚Äù Different theories propose different thresholds, but having **some** threshold is crucial to any definition of poverty.

### 4. Absolute and Relative Poverty
- **Absolute Poverty**  
  This approach establishes an income level deemed necessary to cover basic living needs (nutrition, clothing, housing, etc.). Anyone falling **below** this line is considered poor. Although adjustments may be made for inflation or changes in cost of living, the principle remains: it is a **fixed standard** for the minimum needed to sustain human life.

- **Relative Poverty**  
  This approach assesses whether people can adequately participate in society relative to general living standards. A typical measure is whether someone‚Äôs income (or consumption) is **below 50% of the median**. As the overall median income rises, the relative poverty line also rises.

- **Poverty Line**  
  Whether using absolute or relative measures, some ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù is defined to distinguish those who are poor from those who are not. This threshold is called the **poverty line**.

- **Poverty Rate**  
  The proportion of individuals falling below the poverty line is the **poverty rate**. Depending on which poverty line‚Äîabsolute or relative‚Äîone adopts, the resulting rate can vary significantly.

### 5. International Definitions of Absolute Poverty and the Use of Relative Lines
International organizations and governments often follow guidelines from the World Bank or similar institutions. They define absolute poverty lines using **purchasing power parity (PPP)** and revise these definitions over time. Examples include:
- **Low-income countries:** US\$1.90 per person per day  
- **Middle-income countries:** US\$3.20 or US\$5.50 per person per day, in stages  
- **High-income countries:** Higher thresholds may be used, though **relative poverty measures** are also common

For **relative poverty lines**, a widely used approach is setting a percentage of a country‚Äôs median income. Social welfare policies or specific institutional contexts may lead to different specific thresholds, but the conceptual idea remains the same.

---

### 6. The Sufficientarian Approach
**Sufficientarianism** is a stance in political philosophy and normative economics emphasizing the importance of whether individuals **reach a certain ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù level** of welfare. Specifically:
- Ensuring that no one **falls below** the necessary threshold is the highest priority.  
- Once individuals exceed that threshold, large inequalities above it tend to be seen as less morally or politically urgent.

This perspective aligns well with policy ideas that set a poverty line and focus resources on lifting those below it. Instead of focusing solely on **inequality**, sufficientarianism views **deep disadvantage** (falling below a certain acceptable standard) as the most critical concern.

### 7. Sufficientarianism and the ‚ÄúEquivalent Income‚Äù/Capability Approaches
In previous discussions, we explored **equivalent income** and capabilities. Both aim to assess welfare by considering not just monetary income but also the real constraints or costs individuals face, and how many opportunities or choices they effectively have. In sufficientarianism, the core issue is ‚Äúensuring nobody is below an adequate threshold,‚Äù so these more nuanced welfare measures are highly compatible with that focus. For example:

- Even if two people have the same income, one might incur far higher medical costs or face other burdens, resulting in less **effective** welfare.  
- Capability-focused frameworks, such as Amartya Sen‚Äôs approach, emphasize diverse ‚Äúfunctionings‚Äù like education, health, and social participation‚Äîdimensions that pure income metrics may miss.  
- By employing equivalent income or capability-based assessments, one can more carefully decide what counts as ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù and how to prioritize resources to reduce deep disadvantage.

### 8. Conclusion
This lecture has shown how **the mere measurement of inequality** via tools like the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient cannot fully address the **critical issue of those at the lowest levels**. We explored how poverty lines, absolute and relative poverty, and poverty rates serve to highlight those individuals and measure societal responses.

Sufficientarianism provides an ethical and policy-oriented framework that highlights **ameliorating the plight of those below the threshold** as paramount. Furthermore, **equivalent income** and capability-based approaches enhance our ability to assess who is genuinely below a sufficient level, considering real-world constraints beyond nominal income. Together, these ideas deepen our understanding of **‚Äúwhat should be deemed sufficient‚Äù** and guide us toward more equitable policy interventions.  

As we proceed, the key questions remain: **how** to set poverty lines and thresholds, **which** indicators to use in measurement and evaluation, and **what** we should accept as ‚Äúenough‚Äù in order to ensure a just and decent life for all.
