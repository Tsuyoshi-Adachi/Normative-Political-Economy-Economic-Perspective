# **Harsanyi’s Social Welfare Function**

### Introduction
In economics, the **social welfare function approach** seeks a normative criterion to balance **efficiency** and **equity**. While theories like **Rawls’s difference principle** favor equity and **classical utilitarianism** emphasizes efficiency (maximizing total welfare), it is often challenging to find a theory that lands squarely in between. One promising candidate is **John C. Harsanyi’s approach**, which focuses on **expected subjective welfare maximization**.

### Diminishing Marginal Welfare from Real Income
When using real income in a social welfare function, we cannot assume that a specific increment in income always translates into the same increment in subjective welfare. Specifically:

- The same increase of, say, **\$1,000** will affect a **low-income** individual’s subjective welfare differently than that of a **high-income** individual.
- Generally, **marginal subjective welfare from income** tends to **diminish** as income increases (i.e., an additional dollar is less valuable to someone who is already wealthy).

This **diminishing marginal welfare** underpins the idea that transferring some resources from high-income individuals (who lose less in terms of subjective welfare) to low-income individuals (who gain more in terms of subjective welfare) can be welfare-enhancing—provided such transfers are not too costly in terms of efficiency.

### The Social Contract with a Randomly Assigned Identity
To illustrate Harsanyi’s reasoning, consider this thought experiment:

1. **“Thin Veil of Ignorance”**  
   You do not know who you will be in society; you could end up wealthy or poor with some probability. This is a weaker assumption than Rawls’s more absolute “veil of ignorance,” but the core idea is similar: you are behind a veil, unaware of your specific identity.

2. **Acknowledging Diminishing Marginal Welfare**  
   Because you know that marginal utility of income decreases as income rises, the value of an extra **\$1,000** when you are wealthy is comparatively small, whereas when you are poor, an extra **\$1,000** is very significant.

3. **Rational Proposal for Redistribution**  
   From this uncertain vantage point, you would likely propose some form of redistribution:  
   - “If I turn out to be wealthy, I will give up **\$1,000**. In exchange, if I turn out to be poor, I hope to receive something like **\$700** more. That tradeoff benefits me in expectation.”  
   - Of course, you would not agree to a scheme where the return for being poor is too small compared to what you give up as a wealthy individual. But a moderate transfer makes sense if it increases overall expected welfare.

4. **Conclusion**  
   Under such a hypothetical social contract, the state would **redistribute** to some extent. However, if the **costs of redistribution** (such as efficiency losses or distortionary effects) become too great, you would no longer prefer excessive transfers. Thus, Harsanyi’s approach implies **moderate redistribution**—enough to capture the benefits of diminishing marginal utility, but not so much as to incur unacceptable efficiency costs.

### Summary
- **Rawls’s difference principle** emphasizes equity; **classical utilitarianism** focuses on total efficiency. Both are somewhat extreme in their priorities.  
- **Harsanyi’s approach** offers a more **moderate** stance, recognizing diminishing marginal welfare and incorporating **expected subjective utility** under uncertainty about one’s future status.  
- In practice, this reasoning supports **some level of redistribution** so long as it is not excessively costly. Policymakers thus must balance the gains in equity (where marginal utility is high) against potential efficiency losses.  

By conceptualizing welfare in terms of **expected subjective utility**—and acknowledging that not all income increments are created equal—Harsanyi’s social welfare function neatly captures a **middle ground** in the longstanding debate between equity and efficiency.
