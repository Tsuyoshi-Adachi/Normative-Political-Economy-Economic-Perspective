# Welfare Distribution and Economics as a Science

- In previous lectures, we examined various welfare indicators. From here, we will discuss how to select policies based on those welfare measures.  
- First, we will look at how standard economists think about ‚Äúwhat should be done‚Äù and what they see as their own role in that process. This approach is known as the **social welfare function approach**.

## Welfare Distribution

- Suppose society has chosen some indicator (or set of indicators) to represent each individual‚Äôs level of welfare. It might be **real income**, **compensating income**, **subjective well-being**, or a combined ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù of multiple factors. Any choice is possible, but for now, let‚Äôs imagine **real income** for simplicity.  
- Consider listing each individual‚Äôs level of welfare in a table or as a vector‚Äîthis shows the distribution of welfare across society.

- Recall from previous discussions that the information content of such welfare measures can be limited. In particular, while ranking these values may be somewhat meaningful, the exact difference (the ‚Äúinterval‚Äù) between the numbers might not be strictly comparable. We should be cautious about interpretations like ‚ÄúPerson A‚Äôs welfare is exactly twice Person B‚Äôs.‚Äù

## Policy Outcomes and Selection

- **Policy** determines the welfare distribution.  
  [For example, present four bar graphs (A, B, C, D) showing different possible distributions of welfare under different policy choices. Policy A might yield higher overall levels than B, while C and D have similar averages but C is more equal. A may have a higher average but be less equal than C.]
- (As previously discussed) the distribution we refer to here is the **equilibrium** distribution of welfare‚Äîi.e., the outcome after each individual or firm responds optimally (from their own self-interest) to the policy.  
- There are two major evaluation criteria:
  1. A policy that yields **larger overall values** is preferred for its **efficiency**.  
  2. A policy that yields a **more even spread** is preferred for its **equality**.  
- When there is a trade-off between efficiency and equality, it is intuitively not straightforward whether everyone will agree on the same policy. In a democratic society, one would hope to arrive at a collective decision through a process that reflects social consensus.

## Economics as a Science

- Consider the process of policy selection in three broad steps:
  1. Choosing a welfare indicator (or social welfare function).  
  2. Determining the resulting welfare distribution under each possible policy.  
  3. Deciding which distribution is most desirable.  

- The role of **economics as a science** mainly lies in **step (2)**. Specifically, economics aims to investigate, as systematically as possible, how each policy would affect the welfare distribution under the chosen welfare indicator(s). This includes gathering partial insights, such as ‚ÄúHow much would a tax cut increase the demand for electric vehicles?‚Äù‚Äîeven if that alone does not directly measure welfare. All these fragments of information help build a picture of the welfare distribution under each policy.

- This idea underpins the distinction, common in introductory economics, between **positive analysis** (fact-finding) and **normative analysis** (value judgments). Positive analysis is the scientific aspect of economics, which, when combined with normative considerations, enables discussions of which policies are most desirable.

- It is important to note that other parts of this process cannot be done **without any** value judgments. Science alone cannot yield a final verdict. Even for **step (2)**, the effort is enormous; and **steps (1)** and **(3)** are similarly massive tasks for society. Regardless of scientific progress, it is unlikely that policy decisions can ever be fully resolved by technology or statistical analysis. A large portion of policy decisions will always involve societal choices about values and priorities.
