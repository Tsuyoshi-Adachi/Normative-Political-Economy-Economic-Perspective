# Envy-Freeness

## 1. What Is Envy‑Freeness?

### (1) Definitions of Envy and Envy‑Freeness  
- **Envy:** A situation in which an individual prefers the bundle of goods received by someone else to their own and would wish to swap if possible.  
- **Envy‑freeness:** For every individual \(i\), there exists no other individual \(j\) whose bundle is judged “better than” \(i\)’s own bundle; hence \(i\) would not want to trade.  
  In other words, an allocation is envy‑free when nobody envies anyone else’s share.

The key is to focus on **each participant’s subjective preferences—whether they personally wish to exchange—rather than any third‑party welfare comparison**. This allows us to discuss fairness without numerical interpersonal utility comparisons.

## 2. Envy‑Freeness Does Not Always Mean Equal Division

One might associate envy‑freeness with equal splits, but the requirement is only that **no one envies another’s bundle**; perfect equality is not necessary.

### (1) A Simple Two‑Person Example  
Suppose two individuals, A and B, consume goods \(x\) and \(y\).

- A strongly prefers \(x\) and cares little about \(y\).  
- B strongly prefers \(y\) and cares little about \(x\).

If \(x\) and \(y\) were split equally, A might receive too much unwanted \(y\) and B too much unwanted \(x\). Instead, **give A relatively more \(x\) and B relatively more \(y\)**; then A does not envy B’s bundle, and B does not envy A’s. The allocation is envy‑free and more efficient than a simple equal division.

## 3. Distinctive Features of Fairness via Envy‑Freeness

- **No interpersonal cardinal welfare comparisons:** We impose “no envy” purely through each person’s own preference ordering, without statements such as “A’s utility is 10 and B’s is 8.”  
- **Real‑world applications:** Practical allocation tools strive for envy‑freeness, e.g.,  
  - [Spliddit](http://www.spliddit.org/) – a service that computes rent, bill, or task splits aiming to satisfy envy‑freeness.

## 4. Optional: Walrasian Equilibrium under an Equal Initial Endowment  
*(Supplement for students already familiar with microeconomics)*

### (1) Edgeworth Box and Equal Initial Endowments  
In a two‑person Edgeworth box, the point at the **center** (each person initially receives the same quantities) is commonly viewed as the *fairest* starting point. If a competitive (Walrasian) equilibrium is computed from this symmetric endowment, the resulting allocation satisfies:

1. **Envy‑freeness**  
2. **Pareto efficiency** (by the definition of Walrasian equilibrium)

### (2) Why Envy‑Freeness Holds  
- With **identical budgets** stemming from the equal endowment,  
- each consumer maximizes utility subject to the same budget set.  
- If one consumer envied another’s bundle, they could have chosen it themselves—contradiction.  
Hence the equilibrium bundles are mutually envy‑free.

This shows that **starting everyone at the same point and letting a competitive market work can simultaneously achieve efficiency and envy‑freeness (for the goods traded).**

### (3) Caveat: Non‑Transferable Productivity or Ability  
When productivity factors (talent, skill, physical ability) cannot be transferred:

- Giving B A’s working hours does not transfer A’s special skills.  
- Merely reallocating goods cannot offset fundamental capability differences, so complete envy‑freeness may fail.

## 5. What “When I Put Myself in Your Shoes” Means

Envy‑freeness judges fairness **solely by whether each person envies others for the goods allocated**; this can be misunderstood.

### (1) Fairness Only over the Allocated Goods  
Envy‑freeness concerns the division **of the specific goods/services in question**, not overall wellbeing (which may include health, abilities, etc.).

### (2) Example: Bed‑ridden A and Healthy B  
- A, confined to bed, may value mobility‑related goods very little.  
- Transferring all such goods to B leaves A non‑envious, so the split is envy‑free—  
  yet overall wellbeing is clearly unequal.

### (3) Implications for Capability Approaches  
Achieving genuine welfare equality would require considering **capabilities—what people can actually do**—not just transferable goods. Because abilities are hard to transfer, envy‑freeness often remains a **“closed” fairness notion limited to the goods being divided**.

## 6. Summary

- **Envy‑freeness**: no one prefers anyone else’s bundle; fairness judged via subjective preferences.  
- It need not coincide with equal division; preference‑sensitive allocations can be both efficient and envy‑free.  
- Under equal initial endowments, a competitive (Walrasian) equilibrium can achieve both Pareto efficiency and envy‑freeness.  
- However, ignoring non‑transferable abilities means envy‑freeness does **not** guarantee equality of overall welfare.

Thus, envy‑freeness is a powerful criterion for **allocative fairness of goods**, but it cannot alone eliminate all welfare inequalities in society.
