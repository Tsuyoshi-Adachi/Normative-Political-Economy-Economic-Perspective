# Population Ethics and Social Welfare Functions

---

## Introduction

- **Treating Population as a Variable**  
  In contemporary policy debates—such as immigration and measures to address declining birthrates—it is crucial to see population not as a fixed constant but as a variable that can be influenced by policy decisions. For example, whether to allow more immigrants or to implement policies to boost fertility rates fundamentally alters the size and composition of the population.

- **Evaluating Through a Social Welfare Function**  
  By using a “Social Welfare Function” to assign a score to the distribution of well-being (utility) across a population (including potential future members), we can formally discuss whether it might be worth lowering the average well-being somewhat to achieve a larger population, or whether it is better to maintain a smaller population with higher per-capita well-being.

- **Ethical Challenges**  
  Once we start treating population as variable, we face ethical dilemmas. Adding or excluding individuals based on their well-being levels can lead to judgments that appear uncomfortably harsh or ethically problematic. These challenges are central to **population ethics**.

## Repugnant Conclusion

1. **The Well-Being Threshold (0)**  
   - Suppose we set a threshold of well-being at 0 to distinguish whether life is “worth living” or not. In other words, a negative well-being level would indicate that a person’s life is worse than non-existence.  
   - Under **total (summative) utilitarianism**, adding individuals with negative well-being would reduce the total sum of well-being. Thus, it seems reasonable to avoid increasing the population by adding lives below zero well-being.

2. **Adding Extremely Large Numbers of People with Very Low Positive Utility**  
   - Consider now a scenario in which each new individual has a well-being level just slightly above 0—say 0.00001. If these individuals are added in extremely large numbers (e.g., many billions or even vastly more), the total sum of well-being can become very large simply by accumulating these tiny positive amounts.
   - This can yield a paradoxical result: a society where almost everyone’s life is barely worth living might, by sheer numbers, have a higher total well-being than our current society.  
   - This disturbing outcome—where a seemingly undesirable society is deemed “better” in total—is known as the **Repugnant Conclusion** (famously discussed by Derek Parfit).

## Sadistic Conclusion

1. **Shifting from Total to Average Utilitarianism**  
   - One might think that by focusing on **average** rather than **total** well-being, we could avoid the Repugnant Conclusion. Under average utilitarianism, adding more people would only be beneficial if doing so does not lower the average level of well-being.

2. **However, a Different Ethical Problem Emerges**  
   - Under average utilitarianism, it can sometimes be beneficial (for the average) to **exclude** a large number of individuals whose well-being is just below the current average, and **replace** them with a small number of individuals whose well-being is negative—but not so negative as to lower the new, smaller group’s average.  
   - For instance, compare two groups:  
     - Group A: (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7)  
     - Group B: (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, -1)  
     If you remove all the “7”s (a large group) and replace them with a small number of “-1” individuals, the smaller group of mostly 10s might have a higher **average** well-being than the larger group. In other words, the average can rise even though you have added some negative well-being.  
   - This outcome is referred to as the **Sadistic Conclusion**: policy decisions that seem counterintuitive or cruel (like adding negatively happy people in small numbers while excluding many people with slightly below-average utility) could be justified if they increase average utility.

## One Proposed Solution

- **Introducing a Positive Critical Level (\(\alpha > 0\))**  
  One approach to escaping both the Repugnant Conclusion and the Sadistic Conclusion is to adopt a modified version of total utilitarianism that uses **two thresholds**:
  1. A threshold at 0 to decide whether life is worth living or not.  
  2. A higher, positive critical level \(\alpha\) to determine whether adding a new person’s utility above \(\alpha\) provides a net social benefit.  

  In other words, only the portion of an individual’s utility exceeding \(\alpha\) contributes positively to the social welfare sum. This is sometimes referred to as **critical-level utilitarianism**.

- **Advantages and Limitations**  
  - A key advantage is that by setting \(\alpha\) above 0, simply adding vast numbers of people with a just-barely-positive utility does not inflate the overall social welfare to an extreme degree.  
  - However, the question “What value of \(\alpha\) is the right one?” remains. Determining \(\alpha\) can be philosophically and ethically challenging, and there is no single universally accepted answer.  
  - Population ethics thus remains a field of active debate, reflecting deeply rooted ethical judgments about well-being, life’s value, and how society should count the interests of potential persons.

## Summary

- In welfare economics where population is not fixed, defining a **social welfare function** becomes more intricate. Ethical issues arise in deciding how to include or exclude individuals based on their well-being.
- **Total utilitarianism** can lead to the **Repugnant Conclusion**, where a huge number of minimally satisfied lives might be ranked as better than a smaller population with higher well-being.  
- **Average utilitarianism** can give rise to the **Sadistic Conclusion**, where excluding many moderately happy individuals and replacing them with a few negatively happy individuals raises the overall average.  
- A proposed remedy is **critical-level utilitarianism**, which sets a positive threshold \(\alpha\) for well-being. While it potentially avoids some of these conclusions, debates continue regarding the appropriate level of \(\alpha\) and other ethical and philosophical implications.
- In practical policymaking—such as immigration or fertility measures—these theoretical considerations remind us to evaluate not just average or total income/utility, but how newly included (or excluded) individuals fare relative to normative thresholds of a life worth living and a society’s desired quality of life.
