### What is “Public Philosophy”?

- In fact, “public philosophy” does not exist as an independent academic field.
- This course name refers to studying both the normative aspects of political science (i.e., political philosophy) and economics (i.e., welfare economics) in parallel as part of our faculty’s liberal arts curriculum.

### What is Welfare Economics?

- Welfare economics is a branch of economics that analyzes what it means for a policy to be beneficial to society.
- However, it is not philosophy per se. In welfare economics, once we define what “beneficial to society” means, we then examine what can be said scientifically based on that definition.

### Thinking About What “Beneficial to Society” Means

Consider the following questions:

- **Question 1**: There are two people, A and B. Please divide 1,000 yen between them in a fair way.
- **Question 2**: This division is being conducted for the second time, and in the first trial, Person A received the entire 1,000 yen. Given that, how would you divide another 1,000 yen fairly?

From these questions, two important observations emerge:

1. We often assume that judging what is good or bad in society is a matter of personal opinion. Yet, people’s judgments can sometimes coincide in surprisingly consistent ways.
2. On the other hand, small differences in information or circumstances can drastically change those judgments.

### Social Desirability Is Not Merely Emotional

Does having more information automatically lead to better judgments? Let’s consider an example. Suppose someone argues, “Because older people are adults as well, there is no need to offer them special consideration in public transportation.” However, this person was actually annoyed that morning after witnessing an elderly person violating certain rules. Knowing this, you might suspect that the argument stems from a momentary emotional reaction rather than a reasoned view of what is beneficial for society.

This suggests that simply increasing information is not the fundamental issue. Rather, the critical point here is that we regard “assessments of social desirability” not as emotional reactions, but as matters for rational consideration.

In other words, determining what constitutes a “socially desirable condition (justice)” is not a psychological question about which stimuli trigger a sense of justice, nor is it an entirely emotional or purely objective concept. It is a philosophical question that calls for rational thought.

### Why Study Welfare Economics or Political Philosophy?

Unfortunately, studying welfare economics or political philosophy does not reveal the “true nature” of social desirability. In reality, many scholars present various interpretations, and the debate remains ongoing.

So, what is there to learn? Is it pointless to explore debates that do not produce definitive conclusions?

In fact, the role of political philosophy and welfare economics is to organize and make comparable the diverse standards of “social desirability” that people hold. For example, some views prioritize equality, while others prioritize freedom. If we abandon discussion by saying, “It differs for each person, so there’s no point in debating,” we neglect opportunities for dialogue or consensus-building, and risk a situation where only certain individuals’ opinions are reflected in policy. This poses a danger because fair decision-making requires incorporating a broad range of opinions and values.

As part of a liberal arts education, this course aims to help you learn how to communicate with people whose values or judgments differ from your own, through the lens of political philosophy and welfare economics. Concretely, you will learn to understand the differences between your own standards and those of others, and to effectively convey your perspective. The goal is not to force your position on others, but rather for everyone to accurately recognize the differing standards each person brings to the discussion.

That is why this course includes group discussions and special lectures by instructors from diverse fields.
