# Core Stability

## 1. What Is **Core Stability**?

### (1) Comparison with Envy‑Freeness  
- The **envy‑freeness** we have studied so far is an **individual, subject‑ive fairness** criterion: *no one prefers someone else’s bundle to their own*.  
- **Core stability**, by contrast, is a **co‑operative game‑theoretic** criterion: *no coalition accepts an allocation that gives it less than what its members could obtain on their own*.  
  - If a coalition could do strictly better by seceding and acting independently, it might leave the grand coalition (society). The set of allocations immune to every such deviation is called the **core**.

### (2) Intuition behind Core Stability  
- Core theory asks how to divide the surplus created when **all members of society co‑operate**.  
- For **every coalition (subset of players)** we assume: *if its members could obtain a larger payoff by co‑operating only among themselves, they will do so*.  
- Hence, an allocation in the core guarantees each coalition at least as much as it can generate internally—respecting a form of **collective “minimum rights”**.

## 2. Joint Production and Core Stability

Virtually every product in society is the result of **co‑operation among multiple players**—whether R&D, business alliances, or political coalitions. Core stability offers a lens for distributing the value **jointly created**.

### (1) How should the surplus be divided?  
- Suppose a new technology invented by **A** is useless without **B**’s existing technology.  
  - If B demanded *all* the profits, citing A’s dependence on B, is that really justified?  
- Even without B, A could have pursued some other project and earned **at least a baseline payoff**.  
  - That foregone payoff defines how far A is willing to concede in the partnership.  
- Symmetrically, B will demand compensation for the opportunity cost or risk imposed on B’s own technology.

### (2) The allocation conditions implied by Core Stability  
- **Every player (or coalition) must receive at least what it can secure alone.**  
- Otherwise A and B might break away and act independently, undermining the wider social coalition.  
- Generalising this idea yields core theory: the **core** is the set of allocations that leave **no coalition with an incentive to secede**.

## 3. The **Empty Core**

### (1) When the Core Does Not Exist  
- A core exists only if **co‑operation is sufficiently productive**—e.g., larger coalitions create more value.  
- If additional members **do not increase (or even reduce) total value**—because of costs, conflict, etc.—then some coalition can always improve by leaving, and **the core may be empty**.

### (2) Example: Majority‑Voting Games  
- In political majority games, a minority faction’s exit might raise the remaining members’ payoffs, or the minority itself may gain little by staying.  
- Such cases can yield **no stable coalition—i.e., an empty core**.

## 4. Summary: Significance and Limits of Core Stability  

- **Core stability** differs from envy‑freeness: it embeds a **group‑based minimum guarantee**—*no coalition accepts less than its stand‑alone value*.  
- Making the **incentive not to secede** explicit is crucial in real‑world contracts and collective bargaining.  
- When total surplus is small or co‑operation yields little extra value, the **core can be empty**.  
- Where it exists, the core is prized in economics as an allocation that is both **fair (each coalition is satisfied) and stable**.
