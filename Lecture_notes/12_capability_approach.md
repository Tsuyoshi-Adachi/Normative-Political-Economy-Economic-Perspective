# Capability Approach

### Introduction
In previous lectures, we looked at how **mainstream economics** typically starts from the standpoint of “subjective well-being,” using indicators such as “income” or “real income” as proxies. Income is often used because it reflects the breadth of choices a person has, and thus it preserves the individual’s freedom to decide “what makes them happy.”

However, there is a prominent alternative evaluation framework—one that does **not** rely solely on welfarism—proposed by economists themselves: the **Capability Approach**. This chapter introduces the ideas behind the Capability Approach and how it can be applied in practical indices such as the Human Development Index (HDI).

## The Concept of the Capability Approach

### An Evaluation Criterion Beyond Welfarism
- **What is Welfarism?**  
  Welfarism is the view that “individual welfare (well-being) should be the foundation of policy decisions.” In traditional economics, welfare is typically equated with “utility,” and policies are often judged by whether they maximize the sum or average utility across individuals.

- **The Capability Approach does not rely on Welfarism**  
  Proposed by Amartya Sen and others, the Capability Approach argues that instead of focusing solely on “subjective satisfaction,” we should also consider the **objective, multifaceted aspects** of what people can actually achieve in their lives. It asks what individuals are able to be and to do, not just what they happen to choose or consume.

### Analogy with Income
- **Why Income Can Work as a Proxy**  
  As we have seen, income is not a direct measure of subjective well-being. However, in the conventional economic view, income indicates the breadth of options available to a person, thereby preserving the freedom to choose what constitutes happiness for them. Hence, it can serve as a good indirect proxy for potential well-being.

- **The Capability Approach Also Focuses on “Sources”**  
  The Capability Approach focuses not on what people do choose, but on what they **are able** to choose: the “functionings and capabilities” they can achieve. This is somewhat analogous to how income reflects “the range of options” a person has. Nevertheless, capabilities in this framework go beyond goods and services, encompassing opportunities such as education, healthcare, and social participation.

## Extending the Economic Framework
### Limitations of the “Goods ⇒ Consumption ⇒ Utility” Model
Traditional economic welfare analysis often employs a straightforward chain: acquiring goods leads directly to consumption, which then yields utility. While this approach is attractive in its simplicity, it can neglect the fact that the ability to transform goods into actual well-being depends on various underlying capacities. Merely owning food, for instance, does not guarantee nutritional well-being if one lacks the health or knowledge to utilize it effectively.

### Key Idea of the Capability Approach
By centering on what individuals are actually able to do—or have the freedom to do—we recognize that “buying and consuming” is only one piece of the puzzle. Realizing the benefits of goods often requires additional capabilities, such as:
  - Health (the capacity to sustain and use one’s body effectively)
  - Education (the ability to comprehend information and make informed decisions)
  - Social participation (the freedom to engage in community or political life)
  - Environmental conditions (a safe and supportive setting in which one’s capacities can be exercised)

These dimensions form a broader landscape of opportunities—what the Capability Approach calls “capabilities.” A society’s quality of life should therefore be judged by how well it enables people to convert resources into real freedoms and functions, not merely by how many goods they possess.

## Capability Approach in Practice

Let us briefly outline the two core concepts: **functionings** and **capabilities**.

1. **Functionings**  
   - Refers to the actual activities or states a person achieves.  
   - Examples include: “eating a healthy diet,” “getting sufficient sleep,” “receiving an education,” and so on.

2. **Capabilities**  
   - Refers to the set of real opportunities a person has to achieve various functionings.  
   - For instance, “having the means and social environment to obtain a healthy diet” or “having institutional support to pursue education” describes the freedom a person has, regardless of whether they actually exercise it.  
   - The Capability Approach emphasizes that “having the freedom to choose” is as important as (or sometimes more important than) what is actually chosen.

#### Illustrative Examples
- **Example 1: Access to Education**  
  “Functioning” here would be acquiring knowledge by attending school. But for this functioning to be realized, one needs financial resources, feasible commuting methods, and a supportive family environment. The capability element is about whether school attendance is truly an option, rather than a luxury out of reach.

- **Example 2: Health**  
  “Maintaining good health” is a functioning that requires various resources and structures, such as income, food availability, and healthcare services. A person has high capability in this domain if these resources and services are readily accessible, offering them a real choice to remain healthy.

#### The Perspective of the Capability Approach
- **Multiple Indicators**  
  Instead of relying solely on income, the Capability Approach promotes the use of multiple dimensions—health, education, political freedom, etc.—in parallel.

- **Respecting Individual Values while Providing Objective Evaluations**  
  While the importance of specific functionings can vary among societies or individuals, at least maintaining the freedom to achieve fundamental functionings is considered essential for basic human dignity.

## Human Development Index (HDI)
One notable application inspired by the Capability Approach is the **Human Development Index (HDI)** developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The HDI combines three major dimensions to evaluate countries:

1. **Long and healthy life**  
   - Measured through indicators like life expectancy.  
2. **Access to knowledge**  
   - Measured through indicators such as years of schooling or literacy rates.  
3. **Decent standard of living**  
   - Typically measured by per capita income (often in PPP terms).

By considering not just economic growth or GDP but also aspects like health and education, the HDI seeks to capture elements of human development aligned with the idea of enhancing people’s capabilities. Nonetheless, critics argue for incorporating other dimensions, and ongoing efforts aim to refine and expand such indices.

## Conclusion
- **What is the Capability Approach?**  
  - A normative framework that does not rely solely on welfarism.  
  - Focuses on the **range of possible functionings (capabilities)** rather than just subjective well-being or consumption.

- **Analogy with Income**  
  - Income can be viewed as an indicator of “the breadth of one’s choices,” preserving an individual’s subjective well-being freedom.  
  - The Capability Approach similarly seeks to measure the breadth of options but across multiple dimensions beyond goods and services, such as health, education, and social participation.

- **Human Development Index (HDI)**  
  - An index that combines health, education, and income indicators to measure overall human development.  
  - Emphasizes “human development” rather than purely economic metrics.

In short, **the Capability Approach highlights the multi-layered nature of human well-being** that extends beyond the traditional “goods-and-utility” paradigm in economics. Real-world policy analysis and international comparisons increasingly adopt such multidimensional perspectives, aiming to complement straightforward income-based measures with broader indicators that capture genuine freedoms and opportunities for individuals.
