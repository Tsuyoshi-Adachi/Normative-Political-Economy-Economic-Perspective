# Evaluating Welfare Levels Using Real Income

Using **income** as a benchmark for welfare (well-being) can be relatively convincing within a single society. However, when comparing different societies or different time periods, relying solely on nominal income is often insufficient. Therefore, measures such as **real income** and **equivalent income** have been proposed. In what follows, we will first review why income can be a meaningful measure of welfare within one society, then explore how real income and equivalent income might (or might not) work as welfare indicators across societies. Finally, we will use **indifference curves** to illustrate these concepts more clearly.

## 1. Comparing Individuals Within the Same Society

### Why Income Can Serve as a Welfare Indicator
When all consumers face the same set of market prices for goods and services, an individual’s range of choices is essentially determined by their **budget (income)**. The larger a person’s income, the wider the set of possible consumption bundles they can afford.

- **Budget Sets and Choice**  
  If Person A has a higher income than Person B, then Person A’s budget set *contains* Person B’s budget set. If Person B’s chosen consumption bundle looks attractive to Person A, Person A can simply replicate it—and still have enough resources to do something more if desired. This suggests that, under the assumption of **subjective (individual) welfare**, having a higher income can mean having a higher welfare level.

- **Constant Relative Prices**  
  In a single society, we usually assume that the relative prices of goods and services are the same for all individuals. Therefore, comparing incomes directly correlates with comparing purchasing power and, hence, potential welfare levels.

## 2. Comparing Different Societies (1): Real Income

### The Concept of Real Income (Purchasing Power Parity)
When comparing different countries or different time periods, nominal income alone may not reflect *true* purchasing power because price levels—and even relative prices—can vary significantly. One widely used solution is **real income**, often referred to in international contexts as **purchasing power parity (PPP)**. In practice, this involves choosing a representative “consumption basket” and assessing how much money it takes to buy that basket in each society, thereby converting nominal incomes into a common purchasing-power standard.

- **Adjusting for Overall Price Levels**  
  Real income helps us correct for differences in the *average* cost of living. For example, someone earning 30,000 USD in a country with lower overall prices might have a higher real income than someone earning 30,000 USD in a more expensive country.

### The Risk of Overestimation
Despite its usefulness, real income focuses on *aggregate* price-level differences and does not fully account for differences in **relative prices**. Suppose a particular good (cultural, luxury, or otherwise) is extremely expensive in one society, and a consumer there devotes much of their spending to that good. Real income calculations could rate this consumer as “high income.” Yet, in another society, the same good might be much cheaper, allowing people to consume not only that good but many other goods as well.

- **Possibility of Dominated Consumption Bundles**  
  It may happen that a consumer in the first society (where the good is highly priced) appears to have a high real income. But in reality, a consumer in the second society could afford *at least as many units* of that special good (since it is cheaper) plus other goods, thus **dominating** the first society’s consumption bundle. Numerically, the first consumer’s real income is higher, but in a head-to-head comparison of actual consumption choices, the second consumer might have strictly more of every relevant good—and thus enjoy higher subjective welfare.

## 3. Comparing Different Societies (2): Equivalent Income

### The Limitation of Real Income
Real income addresses overall price-level differences but does not unify *relative* prices across societies. Consequently, it can fail to capture how the cost of specific goods (especially those that differ markedly in scarcity or cultural value) may affect subjective welfare.

### The Idea of Equivalent Income
A more refined approach to cross-society welfare comparisons is **equivalent income**. First, we designate one “standard” society, with its own set of prices (a “standard price vector”). Then we ask:

> “If you wanted to achieve the same level of satisfaction (welfare) that you currently have, how much income would you need in this standard society?”

The resulting amount is what we call a person’s equivalent income. A higher equivalent income means that, in the standard society, one would need a large budget to replicate one’s actual level of utility—implying that one’s current welfare (in their own society) is higher.

- **Choice Interpretation**  
  If Person A’s equivalent income is higher than Person B’s (with respect to the same standard society), then within that standard society’s price system, A could afford *any* consumption bundle B can afford and still have something left. Hence, we conclude that A’s utility level is at least as high as B’s.

### High Data Collection Costs
In practice, measuring equivalent income is challenging. Although it resembles **willingness-to-pay (WTP)** methods—because both rely on hypothetical questions—WTP can also be estimated *indirectly* using market data and demand functions. By contrast, for equivalent income:

- **Lack of Established Indirect Estimation**  
  There is no established method to infer equivalent income purely from observed market behavior across multiple societies. One would need precise estimates of each individual’s preferences and consumption bundles under multiple relative price scenarios, which is extremely data-intensive.  
- **Direct Surveys Are Expensive**  
  As a result, large-scale surveys or experiments (asking each person how much money they would need in the standard society) become mandatory, making the approach very costly and prone to potential biases in responses.

## 4. Indifference Curves and Real/Equivalent Income

To solidify our understanding, we can use **indifference curves**—a classic tool in microeconomics—to see how real income and equivalent income align with consumer choice.

1. **Real Income in Terms of Indifference Curves**  
   Real income is often calculated by considering how many units of a “reference basket” can be purchased. Interpreted on a 2D diagram with indifference curves, this can be viewed as the distance from the origin to the intersection point of the budget line that just affords the reference basket. Because that budget line’s slope is tied to the *actual* relative prices in each society, real income will inherently shift with changes in relative price structures.

2. **Equivalent Income via Indifference Curves**  
   Equivalent income, by contrast, fixes the price vector of a standard society. We then ask how much income a consumer would need in that standard society to reach an **indifference curve** corresponding to their current level of utility.  
   - This method is theoretically more precise because it directly matches a given utility level in a *single, fixed* price environment. However, it requires substantial input from consumers (survey or hypothetical questioning), which raises costs significantly.

## 5. Conclusion

- **Within a Single Society**  
  Because everyone faces the same relative prices, comparing incomes is a relatively reliable way to gauge differences in subjective welfare.  
- **Across Different Societies: Real Income**  
  Real income (or purchasing power parity) adjusts for overall price level differences. While useful, it does not unify the relative price structure. As a result, it may overstate or understate welfare if a given society’s relative prices are skewed for particular goods.  
- **Equivalent Income**  
  By fixing a common set of prices in a “standard society,” equivalent income more accurately tracks *true* welfare differences. However, it requires data or surveys that are difficult and costly to implement, and unlike WTP, there is no widely accepted method for inferring it indirectly from market behavior.  
- **Indifference Curve Perspective**  
  Real income can be visualized as how much of a reference basket can be bought under a given price system; equivalent income corresponds to how much one needs under a *fixed* price system to stay on the same indifference curve.  
- **Welfare Measurement Trade-Offs**  
  In many practical situations, real income remains the most accessible way to compare welfare levels across societies, especially when we focus on “average” situations. For policy evaluation involving *changes* in welfare, concepts like **consumer surplus** or WTP might be more pertinent. Meanwhile, **equivalent income** holds promise for measuring *absolute* welfare levels more accurately—but it remains limited by high implementation costs and methodological constraints.

Overall, **real income** is widespread and easy to gather, yet imperfect for capturing all nuances of welfare. **equivalent income** could, in principle, correct for those nuances but faces significant empirical hurdles. Understanding both concepts—and how they appear on an **indifference curve**—helps clarify the assumptions behind any welfare measure used to compare different individuals, regions, or time periods.
