In many situations, people systematically engage in behavior that appears non-rational or inconsistent when viewed in total. </p> <p>One classic example is the tendency to overspend when paying by credit card: the psychological \u201cpain\u201d of parting with money is reduced compared to paying in cash, which often leads to higher expenditure and lower savings. While using a credit card is not inherently bad, this behavior pattern shows how the perceived cost of spending can change depending on the payment method, and how that can lead to less-than-optimal financial decisions.</p> <p>From the perspective of normative analysis in economics\u2014how we evaluate and design policies to promote social or individual well-being\u2014such non-rational tendencies pose a significant challenge. On one hand, relying on \u201cobjective\u201d measures of welfare (i.e., what outside observers might consider universally beneficial) risks overriding individual preferences and thus sliding into paternalism. On the other hand, economics also emphasizes subjective well-being, recognizing that true happiness and preferences can differ from person to person, and that we cannot know others\u2019 subjective satisfaction directly.</p> <p>We have discussed topics such as using demand functions to measure willingness-to-pay, the relationship between income and well-being, and the capability approach (following Amartya Sen), all of which share a common thread: we cannot directly observe an individual\u2019s true subjective welfare, so we generally respect their personal choices as indicators of what is best for them.</p> <p>However, if individuals are prone to non-rational decision-making, the assumption that \u201ca free personal choice = the best choice for the individual\u201d no longer holds. That leads us to the central question: How can we improve individuals\u2019 subjective well-being when there is a risk of non-rational behavior, without resorting to heavy-handed paternalism?</p>"},{"location":"14_nudge_soft_paternalism/#the-dilemma-of-addressing-irrationality-vs-avoiding-paternalism","title":"The Dilemma of Addressing Irrationality vs. Avoiding Paternalism","text":"<p>One might argue that, if non-rational behavior leads people to make choices that damage their own well-being, then government intervention should prevent them from making these mistakes.

If it turns out someone\u2019s choice\u2014though seemingly irrational from the outside\u2014actually aligns with their deeply held values, then governmental intervention overriding that choice is effectively imposing majority values on a minority. This is precisely the risk of paternalism.</p> <p>For instance, consider a policy that mandates forced saving for retirement to counteract \u201ctime inconsistency\u201d or \u201cpresent bias.\u201d While many people do benefit from saving for old age, there may be individuals who truly prefer a lifestyle of richer experiences when they are young and are willing to lead a more modest retirement later on. By enforcing forced saving, the government would be promoting the conventional value of financial security in old age at the expense of a possible minority preference. In this scenario, well-intentioned intervention becomes paternalistic, preventing individuals from expressing their own life choices.</p>"},{"location":"14_nudge_soft_paternalism/#soft-paternalism-and-nudges","title":"Soft Paternalism and Nudges","text":"<p>Given this dilemma\u2014where non-rational behavior can harm subjective well-being, yet strong government intervention risks paternalism\u2014a more subtle approach has been proposed. This approach is known as Soft Paternalism, and a key policy tool within this framework is called a Nudge.</p> <p>Soft paternalism aims to reduce the impact of non-rational mistakes while preserving as much freedom of choice as possible. A \u201cnudge\u201d is a gentle push or prompt that takes advantage of human psychological or behavioral tendencies to guide people toward choices that better align with their own self-interest (as they would likely define it under more reflective conditions). Crucially, nudges do not involve outright bans or strong financial incentives. Instead, they maintain the individual\u2019s ability to opt out or choose differently, thereby minimizing the risk of infringing on genuine personal preferences.</p> <p>Below are two typical examples of nudges:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Automatic (Opt-Out) Enrollment in Retirement or Insurance Plans    Many employers introduce systems where employees are automatically enrolled in a retirement savings plan unless they actively opt out. Research shows that people are generally inclined to stick with the \u201cdefault option,\u201d so this approach can increase participation rates without forcing anyone to save. By harnessing the inertia or status quo bias, such policies encourage better financial preparation for old age without outright compulsion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cafeteria or Supermarket Product Placement    By placing salads, fruits, or other healthy options at the beginning of a cafeteria line or in a more prominent supermarket location, people are more likely to choose them. This \u201csmall tweak\u201d in choice architecture increases the consumption of healthier foods without restricting the availability of other foods. It leverages the tendency for people to select options that are immediately visible and easy to pick up, gently steering them toward a healthier diet.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These interventions serve as a slight push to counteract non-rational habits\u2014such as procrastination or mindless consumption\u2014while leaving individuals free to do otherwise if they consciously wish to. In theory, this resolves some of the tension between respecting autonomy (an anti-paternalist principle) and helping individuals avoid common cognitive biases.</p> <p>Still, debate continues over whether nudges can become manipulative or lead to more covert forms of paternalism. If, for example, a government or corporation uses nudges to steer people toward outcomes that benefit the organization more than the individual, then the line between \u201csoft paternalism\u201d and \u201cunwanted influence\u201d can blur.</p> <p>In any case, the question of how to reconcile the non-rational dimensions of human behavior with a respect for individual subjective well-being remains a major issue in contemporary welfare economics. Soft paternalism and nudges represent promising strategies, but ongoing research, ethical discussion, and policy evaluation will determine how these ideas evolve and are implemented in practice.</p>"},{"location":"14_nudge_soft_paternalism/#take-the-mini-quiz-here","title":"\ud83d\udcdd Take the mini-quiz here","text":""},{"location":"15_welfare_distribution_economics_as_science/","title":"15_welfare_distribution_economics_as_science","text":""},{"location":"15_welfare_distribution_economics_as_science/#watch-the-introductory-video-here","title":"\ud83d\udcf9 Watch the introductory video here","text":""},{"location":"15_welfare_distribution_economics_as_science/#welfare-distribution-and-economics-as-a-science","title":"Welfare Distribution and Economics as a Science","text":"<ul> <li>In previous lectures, we examined various welfare indicators.
