# 2. Review of Surplus

### Definition of Surplus

In our previous discussion, we introduced the idea that individual well-being (utility or satisfaction) is essentially subjective. Here, we focus on how this subjective well-being translates into a measurable concept in market transactions—namely, **surplus** (or **consumer surplus** from the consumer’s perspective).

- **The benefit (utility) from consuming a good is determined by each individual.**  
  The satisfaction you get from consuming a product or service is personal. For instance, one person may find great joy in drinking coffee, whereas another might not enjoy it at all.  

- **Price is not the value of the good, but rather the cost to you.**  
  We often mistake price for the “value” of a product. In economics, however, price is considered the cost you pay to acquire that good.  

- **The difference between the benefit and the price is your surplus (the net gain).**  
  If you are willing to pay a certain amount (your “willingness to pay”) but end up paying less than that, the difference is your surplus, which represents your net gain from the transaction.

### Demand Functions and Benefits

Economists often use **demand functions** to infer people’s willingness to pay (WTP), which is considered a measure of the subjective benefit individuals receive. This is why surplus analysis is so powerful: it connects observed data on market demand to subjective measures of well-being.

#### 1. The Demand Function and Individual Demand Choice

A demand function shows how much of a good will be purchased at each possible price. When looking at the entire market, it is common to see a smooth curve. However, you can imagine it as a sum of “steps,” each step corresponding to an individual’s decision about whether to buy the good at a given price.

- Each individual has a price at or below which they decide “I will buy,” and above which they decide “I will not buy.”  
- When we add up these individual buy-or-not-buy decisions, we get the aggregate market demand function.

#### 2. Correspondence Between Demand Quantity and Willingness to Pay

A key point in reading the demand function is to treat **price as the input** and **quantity as the output**. For each price level:

- Some consumers will find the price too high and will not purchase.  
- Others will find it acceptable or even cheap and decide to buy.  
- The **exact price** at which a person changes their decision (from not buying to buying) reveals their **willingness to pay**, which corresponds to the benefit they perceive from consuming that good.

Thus, each segment or step of the demand curve can be seen as the WTP threshold for a certain group of consumers.

#### 3. Benefit, Price, and Surplus

If an individual’s benefit (in monetary terms) from consuming one unit of a good is equal to their willingness to pay, then their **consumer surplus** is the difference between that willingness to pay and the actual price they pay. Formally:

- **Benefit = Willingness to Pay**  
- **Surplus = Benefit − Price Paid**

On a demand graph, this surplus is often visualized as the area **between** the market price and the demand curve, up to the quantity purchased.

### Summary: Demand Function Areas as Benefits

By plotting the demand curve and examining its areas, we can compare:

- The total amount consumers **actually pay** (price × quantity).  
- The total amount consumers **would have been willing to pay** (the area under the demand curve, up to the quantity purchased).

Their difference represents the **total consumer surplus** in the market. In other words, once we estimate a demand function from real data, we have a way to approximate how much subjective well-being (in monetary terms) the good provides to the entire market.

### Additional Note: Total Surplus

When we talk about **total surplus**, we typically add up all individuals’ surpluses. It is important to remember:

- We are simply summing the net gains of each person.  
- **Why** adding these surpluses leads to a measure of social well-being is a deeper question involving distribution and fairness. We often say “greater total surplus is better,” but this judgment can be contested if we care about how that surplus is distributed among different individuals.

Still, as a starting point, the notion of consumer surplus (and producer surplus, which we will examine later) provides a useful measure of the overall gains from trade in a market.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Surplus** measures the difference between an individual’s benefit (willingness to pay) and the price they actually pay.  
2. **Demand functions** allow economists to infer willingness to pay from observed purchase decisions.  
3. **Total surplus** is the sum of individual surpluses, and is often used as an indicator of social welfare in basic economic analysis—though its interpretation involves ethical and distributional considerations.

In the next steps, we will use this concept of surplus to analyze market efficiency, policy impacts, and various other questions in welfare economics.
