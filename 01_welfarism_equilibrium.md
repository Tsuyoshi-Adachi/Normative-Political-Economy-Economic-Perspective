# Welfarism and Equilibrium

Standard economic theory, when evaluating policies, typically assumes three core elements:

1. A **consequentialist** viewpoint  
2. A **welfarist** criterion  
3. An emphasis on the **equilibrium** outcome resulting from individuals’ optimal responses to the policy

In this session, we will briefly explore these three points.

## 1. Consequentialism

### Overview of Consequentialism
- **Consequentialism** is an approach that judges institutions or policies based on their outcomes (consequences).  
- In other words, rather than focusing solely on the immediate effects after a policy is introduced, we consider all subsequent, long-term impacts in assessing whether the policy is good or bad.  
- Importantly, **being consequentialist does not mean entirely ignoring procedural aspects**. A policy with opaque processes might undermine public trust, ultimately leading to undesirable outcomes. In this sense, procedural factors can be incorporated as part of the consequences.

### Non-Consequentialism (Policy Examples)
- By contrast, **non-consequentialism** (or **deontological** approaches) places independent value on the inherent nature or procedure of an action or institution, rather than evaluating it purely by its outcomes.
- Examples in the policy context:
  - **Prioritizing procedural legitimacy**  
    - Even if a public project promises large benefits, some may argue it cannot be justified if it bypassed a public referendum or transparent procedures. Here, the process itself is considered an independent standard of correctness.  
  - **Absolute respect for rights**  
    - A policy that invades personal privacy or infringes on basic rights could be deemed unacceptable, no matter how beneficial it might be to the broader society.

## 2. Welfarism

### Overview of Welfarism
- **Welfarism** refers to the type of consequentialism that evaluates outcomes based on **social welfare**, often understood in terms of individual utilities or well-being.
- In economics, it is common to define welfare in terms of individual utility, satisfaction, or preference fulfillment, which are then aggregated or compared to assess the desirability of a policy.

### Consequentialist but Non-Welfarist Approaches
- Not all consequentialist approaches use **welfare** (i.e., individual utility) as the standard. We can label these as **consequentialist but non-welfarist**.
  - Example: A policy that aims **primarily** to reduce CO₂ emissions might focus on environmental metrics rather than overall social utility. This still looks at the outcome (reduced emissions) as the guiding measure—hence it is consequentialist—but it is not welfarist if it does not prioritize human well-being or satisfaction as the yardstick.

### Economics’ Standard Approach: Consequentialism × Welfarism
- In mainstream economics, the standard approach is **consequentialist welfarism**:  
  - Evaluate a policy by examining how much it improves (or harms) people’s utility or welfare, including how those utilities are distributed.  
  - Decide whether a policy is good or bad based on whether it leads to higher social welfare in the outcome.

## 3. Equilibrium as the Outcome

### What Is Equilibrium?
- In economics, the “consequences” we evaluate are typically not just the direct, immediate effects of a policy, but the **final situation (equilibrium)** that arises when individuals respond optimally to the new policy environment.
- Individuals (households, firms, etc.) will adjust their behavior in ways that maximize their own utility or profit. The **combined** effect of these changes is the actual outcome—what we call an **equilibrium**.

### An Everyday Example
- **Considering only direct effects**: Suppose a company raises employees’ transportation allowances, expecting “reduced commuting costs and happier employees.”  
- **The equilibrium in practice**: Employees may respond by moving to cheaper homes farther away, increasing the firm’s total reimbursement costs. In turn, the firm might reduce other benefits or salaries to offset higher commuting expenses. Ultimately, everyone’s well-being might differ from the initial expectation, and that final balance of gains and losses is what we must evaluate.

### The Evaluation Flow in Economics
1. Identify the **direct effect** of a policy.  
2. Consider how **agents respond optimally** to the new policy.  
3. Evaluate the **equilibrium** level and distribution of welfare under the new conditions.

This procedure is central to economic policy analysis.

## Summary

1. **Consequentialism**  
   - Policies and institutions are judged by their outcomes. Procedural elements can still matter insofar as they influence or shape those outcomes.  

2. **Welfarism**  
   - A branch of consequentialism that uses **social welfare** (usually based on individual utilities) as the metric.  
   - Standard economics adopts this perspective to gauge policy success via changes in individuals’ utility or well-being.

3. **Equilibrium as the Evaluation Target**  
   - Because people’s actions adjust in response to any new policy, economists focus on the final situation—**equilibrium**—and assess the welfare levels there.

These premises—consequentialism, welfarism, and equilibrium analysis—underlie standard economic methods of policy evaluation. Future lectures will build on this framework to explore more detailed analytical tools and applications in policy-making.
